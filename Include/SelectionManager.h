	 * SelectionManager handles picking of objects.
	 * How this works, you can read at:
	 * http://www.bramstein.nl in the articles section.
	 * A short description of the mouse handling follows.
	 * MouseMotion:
	 * A mousemotion event is sent each frame to the currently focused (selected)
	 * component. This is done so that
	 * a Component can receive MouseMotion events while the mouse is not
	 * actually located at the Component.
	 * MouseEntered, MouseExited:
	 * The mouse location is checked every frame, and each time the mouse
	 * enters or exits an event is sent, this happens independently from the
	 * other events.
	 * MouseClicked, MousePressed, MouseReleased:
	 * when a mouse is pressed, the current location is probed for a Component,
	 * and if found, events are sent.
	 * @note
	 *	This is a Singleton object.
